To help ensure that the situation on the ground is generally peaceful in every educational assistance payout venue, DSWD Field Office 7 deployed its management committee members and other unit heads as team leaders and district monitors all over Central Visayas. 

They are to monitor the areas assigned to them and oversee its operation and process. They will also respond and resolve issues and concerns that may be raised during the conduct of payout. Every site also has an assigned team leader to make sure that the releasing process is smooth and well coordinated. 

The release of AICS Educational Assistance is scheduled every Saturday from August 20 to September 24, 2022. Only those who received a text or email confirmation will be accommodated in today's payout. Strictly no walk-ins. 

For those who did not receive text/email confirmation, those who were not able to register, and for areas not covered in today's activity, the schedules and venues will be announced in the succeeding days prior to payout. Clients must ensure documents are complete and bring two (2) photocopies of every requirement.
